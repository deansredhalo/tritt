### Web Component Custom Elements with events handling and simple data-binding

Tritt is a lightweight, fast, simple-to-use tool for creating inline custom elements complete with Shadow DOM, external style/script imports, encapsulation and of course simple event and data binding.  It allows you to create a web component spec custom element that can be used throughout your page. Like all of my current projects, it's named after a 90s era country star, this one of course is named after none other than Travis Tritt.
